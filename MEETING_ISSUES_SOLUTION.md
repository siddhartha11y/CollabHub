# Meeting Issues - Solutions Implemented

## Issues Identified

### 1. Time Zone Display Problem
**Problem**: Meeting created for 15:41-15:43 (3:41-3:43 PM) but displaying as 8:41:00 PM - 8:43:00 PM

**Root Cause**: 
- Improper timezone handling in date display
- Browser's `toLocaleTimeString()` method was not consistently formatting times
- No proper timezone conversion utilities

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `src/lib/date-utils.ts` with proper timezone handling functions
- Updated meeting display components to use `formatDisplayTime()` function
- Ensures consistent local time display across all meeting views

### 2. Missing Meeting Creator Information
**Problem**: No way to track who created the meeting, leading to confusion about meeting ownership

**Root Cause**:
- Database schema missing `creatorId` field in Meeting model
- No relationship between User and Meeting for creator tracking

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated Prisma schema to include `creatorId` field in Meeting model
- Added relationship between User and Meeting models
- Updated API endpoints to include creator information
- Modified UI to display meeting creator information

### 3. Google Meet Integration Issues
**Problem**: Using placeholder Google Meet links instead of proper integration

**Root Cause**:
- No proper Google Meet API integration
- Static placeholder URLs not providing actual meeting rooms

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `src/lib/google-meet.ts` utility for Google Meet integration
- Implemented Google Calendar integration that automatically adds Google Meet
- Added proper meeting URL generation with calendar event creation

## Files Modified

### Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model Meeting {
  // ... existing fields
  creatorId   String?
  creator     User? @relation("MeetingCreator", fields: [creatorId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  // ... existing fields
  createdMeetings Meeting[] @relation("MeetingCreator")
}
```

### API Updates (`src/app/api/workspaces/[slug]/meetings/route.ts`)
- Added creator information to meeting creation
- Updated GET endpoint to include creator details
- Integrated Google Meet link generation

### Frontend Updates (`src/app/workspaces/[slug]/meetings/page.tsx`)
- Added proper timezone display using new utility functions
- Added creator information display
- Improved meeting card layout with creator details

### New Utilities
- `src/lib/date-utils.ts`: Timezone handling and date formatting
- `src/lib/google-meet.ts`: Google Meet integration utilities

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration
Once database connectivity is restored, run:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. Enhanced Google Meet Integration
For production, consider implementing:
- Google Workspace API integration for direct Meet room creation
- OAuth flow for Google Calendar access
- Automatic calendar invitations for meeting participants

### 3. Additional Features
- Meeting participant management
- Meeting recording capabilities
- Calendar synchronization
- Meeting reminders and notifications

## Testing the Fixes

### Time Zone Fix
1. Create a new meeting with specific time
2. Verify the display shows correct local time
3. Check that times are consistent across different views

### Creator Information
1. Create a meeting as a specific user
2. Verify creator information appears in meeting cards
3. Check that creator details are properly displayed

### Google Meet Integration
1. Create a new meeting
2. Click the meeting URL
3. Verify it opens Google Calendar with Meet integration

## Troubleshooting

### If Time Still Shows Incorrectly
- Check browser timezone settings
- Verify the `formatDisplayTime` function is being used
- Ensure date objects are properly created from ISO strings

### If Creator Information Missing
- Verify database schema has been updated
- Check that API includes creator in response
- Ensure frontend components handle optional creator field

### If Google Meet Links Don't Work
- Verify Google Calendar integration is working
- Check that meeting URLs are properly generated
- Ensure users have Google accounts for calendar access
