# Task Management Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines enhancements to the existing task management system to implement role-based permissions, notifications, activity logging, and controlled task status progression. The system will ensure proper access control and provide comprehensive audit trails for all task-related activities.

## Glossary

- **Task_System**: The CollabHub task management module
- **Assigned_User**: The workspace member to whom a task is assigned
- **Task_Creator**: The user who originally created the task
- **Notification_System**: The system component that displays notifications to users
- **Activity_Log**: The system component that tracks and displays task-related activities
- **Task_Status**: The current state of a task (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, REVIEW, DONE)
- **Status_Progression**: The forward-only movement of tasks through status states

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Assignment Notifications

**User Story:** As a workspace member, I want to receive notifications when tasks are assigned to me, so that I am immediately aware of new responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Task_Creator assigns a task to an Assigned_User, THE Notification_System SHALL display a notification to the Assigned_User
2. THE notification SHALL contain the task title, creator name, and assignment timestamp
3. THE notification SHALL appear in the navigation bar notification area
4. THE notification SHALL persist until the Assigned_User acknowledges it
5. THE Notification_System SHALL only show notifications to the specific Assigned_User

### Requirement 2: Task Status Control Permissions

**User Story:** As an assigned user, I want exclusive control over my task status changes, so that only I can update the progress of tasks assigned to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task has an Assigned_User, THE Task_System SHALL only allow the Assigned_User to modify the Task_Status
2. WHEN a task has no Assigned_User, THE Task_System SHALL allow any workspace member to modify the Task_Status
3. THE Task_System SHALL prevent all users except the Assigned_User from accessing status change controls
4. THE Task_System SHALL display status change buttons only to authorized users
5. THE Task_System SHALL return an authorization error when unauthorized users attempt status changes

### Requirement 3: Forward-Only Status Progression

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want task status changes to follow a forward-only progression, so that work progress is accurately tracked and cannot be reversed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Assigned_User changes Task_Status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS, THE Task_System SHALL prevent reverting to TODO
2. WHEN an Assigned_User changes Task_Status from IN_PROGRESS to REVIEW, THE Task_System SHALL prevent reverting to TODO or IN_PROGRESS
3. WHEN an Assigned_User changes Task_Status from REVIEW to DONE, THE Task_System SHALL prevent reverting to any previous status
4. THE Task_System SHALL only display status options that represent forward progression
5. THE Task_System SHALL validate status transitions on the server side

### Requirement 4: Task Deletion Permissions

**User Story:** As a task creator, I want exclusive rights to delete tasks I created, so that task integrity is maintained and only I can remove my created tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Task_System SHALL only allow the Task_Creator to delete their created tasks
2. THE Task_System SHALL display delete options only to the Task_Creator
3. THE Task_System SHALL prevent all other users from deleting tasks they did not create
4. THE Task_System SHALL return an authorization error when unauthorized users attempt task deletion
5. THE Task_System SHALL require confirmation before task deletion

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Task Activity Logging

**User Story:** As a workspace administrator, I want detailed activity logs for all task operations, so that I can track task lifecycle and user actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created, THE Activity_Log SHALL record the Task_Creator, task title, and creation timestamp
2. WHEN a task is assigned, THE Activity_Log SHALL record the Task_Creator, Assigned_User, and assignment timestamp
3. WHEN Task_Status changes, THE Activity_Log SHALL record the Assigned_User, previous status, new status, and change timestamp
4. WHEN a task is deleted, THE Activity_Log SHALL record the Task_Creator, task title, and deletion timestamp
5. THE Activity_Log SHALL display all task activities in chronological order with user attribution

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Task Display Information

**User Story:** As a workspace member, I want to see task creator and assignee information directly on task cards, so that I can quickly identify task ownership and responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Task_System SHALL display the Task_Creator name below each task title
2. THE Task_System SHALL display the Assigned_User name below each task title when assigned
3. THE Task_System SHALL use consistent text styling for creator and assignee information
4. THE Task_System SHALL show "Unassigned" when no Assigned_User exists
5. THE Task_System SHALL update display information immediately when assignments change
